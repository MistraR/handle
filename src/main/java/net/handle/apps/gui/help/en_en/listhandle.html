    <h1>List Handles Help </h1>
    <p>
The "List Handles" function of the Handle Admininstration Tool sends a request 
to a service to list all of the handles for a specific prefix.  In order 
to be able to list handles the administrator must have the "List Handles" permission
enabled in the prefix handle.
<br><br>
To list handles, select 'Server Admin' from the main Handle Administration Tool menu,
then click 'List Handles'.
<br><br>
  The List Handles function is implemented in the most recent CNRI handle server, 
but if your handle database is very large, the list handles command may time-out 
since the database used by the CNRI handle server is not optimized for this kind 
of operation.
