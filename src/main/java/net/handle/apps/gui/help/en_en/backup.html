    <h1>Checkpoint and Recovery Help </h1>

<p>
NOTE: This method of server backup is deprecated.  We currently recommend 
the use of the BDBJE handle storage, which allows direct copying of files 
during operation.  For more information

<p>
The Backup Server function of the admin tool sends a request to a server
to checkpoint its internal handle database.  In order to be able to checkpoint
a server, the administrator must be identified as an administrator for that 
server (in the backup_admins section of the config.dct file on the server).
</p><p>
The checkpoint operation consists of several steps.  Upon receiving an
authenticated request to backup the database, the server will
<ol>
 <li> Copy the main database files (handles.jdb and nas.jdb) to backup
    files (handles.bak and nas.bak)
 <li> Reset the transaction log (dbtxns.log)
</ol>
</p><p>

After these steps the handles.bak and nas.bak files can be safely
copied to another location for a backup.  The dbtxns.log file will contain
all of the changes made to the database since the handles.bak and
nas.bak files were made.  The dbtxns.log file will allow you to restore 
the backup up to the last transaction that was successfully 
performed if something were to go wrong with the main database.
</p><p>

To perform the checkpointing, enter the IP address and port number of the server
that you want to perform the checkpoint operation.  <font color=red>Note:</font>
During the checkpoint process, the server will reject all requests to create, modify,
or delete handles.  For this reason, it is usually preferable to perform the 
checkpoint operation when there is little administrative activity on the server.
Checkpoint operations should only be performed on primary servers since secondary
servers do not keep transaction logs for their databases.
</p><p>

To recover the database using the backup files and transaction log you can perform
the following steps:
<ol>
 <li> Make sure that the server is NOT running.
 <li> Make extra copies of all files (doesn't hurt to be safe!)
 <li> Run the command: <pre>java -cp handle.jar net.handle.apps.tools.RecoverJDB  &lt;server_dir&gt;</pre>
 <li> Restart the server.  The server should now have its database restored to it's pre-disaster
      state.
</ol>
