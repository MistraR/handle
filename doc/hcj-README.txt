HDL(R) CLIENT LIBRARY

Please be sure you have read the LICENSE.txt and agree to the terms.

The HDL Client Library is a library of Java classes which
understands the handle protocol and would form the foundation for Java-
based custom client software development.

PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS IN ORDER.

1) Install Java version 8 or higher on your computer.
   Note: if you already have Java installed on your computer, type
   'java -version' at the command prompt to find out what version has been
   installed.

2) Download, gunzip, and untar the distribution.

3) Under the new handle-client-9.2.0 directory, there will be an doc
   directory, a lib directory with several jar files, a bin directory
   with various scripts to call client tools, and
   handle-client-9.2.0-src.zip.

   To view the client library source code and begin development of
   custom client applications, you will need to unzip the
   handle-client-9.2.0-src.zip file.

4) Please send all comments, questions and bug reports to
   hdladmin@cnri.reston.va.us.


Thank you for your interest in CNRI's HANDLE.NET SOFTWARE.
