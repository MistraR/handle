Individual or Organization ("Licensee") that has installed or
otherwise used the HDL® Client Library (ver. 9) – Java™ Version

conditions of this License Agreement upon Licensee's accessing,
installing or otherwise using the Software.

2. CNRI hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, fully paid-up,
world-wide license to use, reproduce, distribute, perform and/or
display publicly, and prepare derivative works based on the Software,
and to authorize others to do so, in source or binary form, provided,
however, that CNRI's copyright notice and this License Agreement are
both retained in the LICENSE.txt file of the Software alone, or in any
derivative version prepared by Licensee.

3. CNRI is making the Software available to Licensee on an "AS IS"
basis.  CNRI MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, CNRI MAKES NO AND

AS A RESULT OF USING, MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE SOFTWARE, OR ANY
DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

5. The License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material
breach of its terms and conditions. Nothing in the License Agreement
shall be deemed to create any relationship of agency, partnership, or
joint venture between CNRI and Licensee. The License Agreement does
not grant permission to use the mark CNRI in a trademark sense to
endorse or promote products or services of Licensee, or any third
party.

6. The License Agreement shall be governed by United States Federal
law, and, to the extent such Federal law does not apply, by the law of
the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding Virginia's conflict of law
provisions, and the courts within such State shall be the only courts
of competent jurisdiction.
